Puddles!
Staring; Square, and Triangle

Square goes outside to play after a rain storm, and decides to jump into a puddle. 
He accidentlly splashes Triangle, who, not likeing being splashed hits Square on the head.
Square starts to cry, and becoming concerned Triangle comforts him. Square stops crying and they
both start jumping for joy.

(This has to be THE Lamest thing I have ever written, I basically had no story and made up the animation as
I went along.)

In this short animation I used Squash and Stretch, Slow in and Slow out, and Secondary actions,
As well as Timing (very important) and Pose to Pose.

I also used color to indicate moods; white for nutral, blue for sad, red for angry, yellow for concern,
and green for happy.
